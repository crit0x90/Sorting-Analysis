\section*{Introduction}
	The goal of this project was to learn about several different
	sorting algorithms and the relationship between their time 
	complexities and their real world run times. This was achieved
	by implementing each algorithm in C++ and observing, graphing, 
	and comparing the changes in run times for each algorithm when 
	using different lengths and configurations for the array. A
	statistical analysis of the run times of each configuration
	and algorithm was also performed.

\section*{Methods}
	The algorithms that were implemented were the insertion sort,
	selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort. Each 
	sorting algorithm was ran with arrays of lengths 10, 1000, 10,000,
	100,000, and 1,000,000. The four different configurations for
	the arrays were already sorted, randomly shuffled, sorted in reverse,
	and shuffled at 10 percent. Each combination of array length and 
	configuration was sorted 100 times using each algorithm to produce the
	data for the statistical analysis. A menu system to allow a user to 
	choose the type of sort, the length of the array, and the type of the
	array was also implemented.
