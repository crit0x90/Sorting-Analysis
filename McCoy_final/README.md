# Sorting-Analysis

Author: Scott McCoy

The purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of different
sorting algorithms and to provide an analysis on their performance. This project
contains a custom array class with a variety of operations available including 
5 different sorting algorithms. This project also contains a full report and
tests for the sorting functions that go with the array. This project is intended
to be ran on a Linux system and because of the way that files are referenced in
the program it will probably not work on other platforms.
